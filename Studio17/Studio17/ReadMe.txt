2.	We constructed both a reference to an abstract file and a image file, and all of the basic functions 
	that we created worked as expected

3.	Programming a client to use an interface instead of a concrete class allows us to make a more general file,
	which makes it much easuer to integrate different file types which have different implementations for the same
	function signature.

4.	We would only need to add another exception to look at the signature of the file name so that we can identify
	a file of a type we have not already implemented.

5. unit tests passed
